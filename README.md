# üç∑ WineFonts
Just a repository containing all of the default fonts bundled with Windows 11 (as of Feb 11, 2024) so that you can use them inside of Wine / CrossOver.

`fonts.exe` in the Releases page works by simply copying over 692 fonts to the Windows fonts directory.

# Installation
To use WineFonts, go to the [latest release](https://github.com/numelon-oss/WineStarterKit/releases/latest), download and run `fonts.exe` inside of Wine or CrossOver.
